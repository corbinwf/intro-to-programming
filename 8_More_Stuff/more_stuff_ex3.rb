# Exception handling is code that is written to deal with errors.
# For example, if the program is running through a block of code and
# an error occurs, excpeption execution can note the error and continue
# running the code instead of stopping at the error.

#Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an 
#error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by 
#changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
